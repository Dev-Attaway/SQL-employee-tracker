## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases easily. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
## Installation

## Usage
This application is accessed through a CLI or an integrated terminal and must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to execute  the initialization from the CLI.
Must also have [MySQL Shell ](https://www.mysql.com/) or a SQL interface supporting development and administration for the MySQL Server.
## Contributing
No further contributions for consideration, develop from your fork
